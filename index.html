              As someone who has always loved logic and reason, I have found my
              perfect career in software engineering. Each problem I come across
              is another little puzzle to solve. The beauty of coding is that
              computers are entirely rational. If there is ever an issue, it is
              not because my tools are broken. It is because my understanding of
              the logic is flawed. And I can't stop until I fix that gap.

              I am currently a full stack developer specializing in JavaScript
              and the NERDS (Node.js, Express, React, Databases using SQL)
              stack, and I am always open to exploring new technologies.

              On a personal level, I am a huge basketball fan (both playing and
              watching). I also enjoy skiing and hanging out with my girlfriend
              and dog!
